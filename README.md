1. Introduction and Setting

The user's goal is to control the rabbit to collect 10 flower buds(red ball like) before the timer reaches "10000".

In this game, there is a rabbit on the grass ground. There are some pumpkins(as decorations) and flower buds on the ground. There is also a piece of background music.

 Press "Down" will make the rabbit move away (backwards) from the user.
 Press "Left" will make the rabbit move left.
 Press "Right" will make the rabbit move right.
 Press "Space" will restart the game.

3. Other Rules

  a) To collect buds, the body of the rabbit(the white cube part) need to collide with the buds.
  b) The rabbit will not be able to move outside the grass ground.
  c) Each time only one bud will be collected (i.e. The score will increase by 1)
  d) After time is up (The timer reaches 10000), the user could choose to either continue collecting    
     (But it will not show "YOU WIN" after the score reaches 10) or restart game by pressing "Space"
